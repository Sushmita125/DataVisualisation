# DataVisualisation

As part of my college coursework ,I created an interactive ‘dashboard’ style visualisation to enable analysis and exploration of different accommodations in Ireland using Vega Lite .This visualisation contains three linked charts that interact with each other. 
The point geo map shows the location of various accommodations in Ireland. Each point is coloured according to type of accommodation. Clicking on an individual point should bring you to the website associated with that accommodation .The bar chart  shows the number of accommodations in each county .It should be possible to select multiple counties using the bar chart .The chart at the bottom of the image is a strip chart that shows the capacity of accommodations. Selecting on this strip chart should also update the other two charts It is possible to select the range of beds to understand which county has the selected range of accommodations. It is possible to use all interactions together.

The key findings were that highest hotel accommodations were in Dublin . 
The B&B accommodations were highest in the county Kerry and Hostel accommodations in Galway.
The hostel have a capacity of 200 beds, the hotels have capacity of  400 beds followed by 20 for B&B which has least capacity.
